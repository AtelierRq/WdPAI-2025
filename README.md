This app is a booking app for the hostel, specifically the "Dębowy Jar" Tourist Settlement. The app allows guests to select a convenient date for their visit. After selecting and entering the necessary information, the owner receives a booking request and can accept or decline it. In addition to booking dates, the app also includes other information, such as information about the hostel, a photo gallery, attractions within the hostel and nearby attractions, places to visit in the area, news and events in the area, seasonal attractions, and more. The overall design is orange, white, and black, just like the current Dębowy Jar website.
